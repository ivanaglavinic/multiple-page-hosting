    <h1>üç¶Ice Cream</h1>
    <p>
      Ice cream has ancient origins, with early forms dating back to China
      around 200 BC, where a frozen mixture of milk and rice was enjoyed. The
      concept spread to Europe, and by the 17th century, Italian and French
      chefs refined ice cream as we know it today. It became popular in the U.S.
      in the 18th century, with the invention of modern ice cream machines in
      the 19th century revolutionizing its production.
